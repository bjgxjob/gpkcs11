# This directory contains the files that are different for the windows
# gdbm from the UNIX gdbm library. 
#
# In order to use it simply copy all files from gdbm-1.8.0 into this directory,
# as long as there is not a file of the same name allready in this directory.
# 
# If you are accessing your files from a UNIX based Samba server the best way
# is to use symlinks on the UNIX box like this: ( you can call this whole
# file like this: sh README )

# This way the files will apear as regular on your Windows network
# drive. While there are some files that are not nessecary to build the
# library on windows they don't harm either.
# 
# The Visual C project files that are included assume that all files are
# visible in this directory.
